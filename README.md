# GOAL
The goal of this project is to implement eco-evolutionary diversification-inspired solutions to perform computational sustainability discovery based on rapidly diversifying traits and interactions}. The exploitation of emerging interactions, strategies and traits will allow us to create novel discovery solutions for natural ecosystems facing sustainability challenges like overexploitation of the ocean, where harvesting renewable resources are beyond the diminishing returns for many species and ecosystem resources.

METHODS
1. Standarize data to account for different parts of the data having different units
2. Write down the structure of the Bayesian probabilitic causal graph (BPCG) accounting for 
sampling heterogeneity and bias. For example, gears should be represented as a node. 
3. Write down the full BPCG as conditional probability tables from each node (i.e., drawn given the parent node and the data) from which we can estimate differential strength between each gear and each fish species. Data comes from the data to fill out the BPCG to explore the total sampling heterogeneity and bias.
